# DesignPatterns
# Project for making a pizza using Builder pattern, Facade pattern and Command pattern
# User chooses one of 3 types of pizza in the menu - Hawaiian, Formaggi, Pepperoni
# The Waiter gets the order and sends it to the PizzaMaker using the command pattern
# The PizzaMaker checks the pizza type and makes it using the Builder pattern 
# When the pizza is made, the Facade pattern combines the pizza name and the calories and returns them, so they can be shown to the user
